# WebScraping
Repository dedicated to testing web scraping techniques with different filters and storing filter applications.

We will use two filters on the website https://news.ycombinator.com/ and these are:

Filter all entries with more than five words in the title ordered by the number of comments first.
Filter all entries with less than or equal to five words in the title ordered by points.

The filters applied by the user and their timestamp are saved in a SQLite database.
